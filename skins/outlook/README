Roundcube skin by Tecorama (http://roundcubeskins.net)
======================================================

This Roundcube skin works on both desktop and mobile browsers. In order to enable the automatic skin mode switching
depending on the device being used to browse the mail and to make the skin compatible with some third party
plugins that don't support skining, you should enable the included rcs_skins plugin.

Roundcube compatibility
-----------------------

The skin is compatible with Roundcube 1.1.x. It will not work properly with earlier versions or unreleased 
beta versions of Roundcube.

Browser compatibility
---------------------

The skin is compatible with all modern browsers.

Installation
------------

To install the skin follow these steps:

1. Copy the directories 'skins' and 'plugins' to the directory where your Roundcube is installed.

2. Enable the plugin 'rcs_skins': Edit the file 'config/config.inc.php', find the line that begins with 
"$config['plugins']" and add the plugin to the beginning of the array, like this:

$config['plugins'] = array('rcs_skins');

IMPORTANT: Make sure the rcs_skins plugin is included as the VERY FIRST plugin in the array, before any other plugins. 
The rcs_skins plugin will fix the other incompatible plugins only if it's listed at the very beginning of the array.

NOTE: The following old plugins are obsolete and should be removed from your plugins array:

rcs_mobile_options
rcs_mobile_switch
nutsmail_theme_selector

The functionality of these plugins has been superceded by rcs_skins. If you have any of these plugins in your plugin 
array, please remove them to avoid errors.

3. (Optional) If you'd like to use the skin on the Roundcube login screen and as the default skin for newly created user 
accounts, edit 'config/config.inc.php' and follow the steps applicable to your situation:

a) If you will use the same skin for all device types, find the setting $config['skin'] and set it to the name of the 
skin you want to use. If this setting doesn't exist, add it at the end of the file, like this:

$config['skin'] = '<skin-name>';

b) If you want to use different default skins for desktop, tablet and phone devices, add the following lines at the end 
of the file and specify the skins you want to use:

$config['desktop_skin'] = '<skin-name>';
$config['tablet_skin'] = '<skin-name>';
$config['phone_skin'] = '<skin-name>';

These settings will only work if the the rcs_skins plugin is loaded. They will take precedence over the setting 
specified in $config['skin'].
